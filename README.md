NetTesting
==========

A homegrown testing framework for usage, well, anywhere! Supply it a target assembly and it'll test away.

This project was made initially to write simple unit tests for some internal usage classes for a project in unity.
The "NoThreads" project, as well as the core project are set to compile for .NET 3.5, while the threads will execute
in .NET 4.5.
